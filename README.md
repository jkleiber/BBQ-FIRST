# BBQ-FIRST
This is the most recent work-in-progress code for BBQ FIRST.

BBQ FIRST was started in 2015 as a way to track FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) event strength via humorously named statistical metrics. While the metrics themselves are thematic, the data gives insight into the strength of any given event by ranking them against each other using historic team performance.

As of right now there are 4 data points that BBQ FIRST shows:
 - BBQ (Blue Banner Quotient)
 - SAUCE (Basically BBQ using all post 2005 blue banners)
 - BRIQUETTE (BBQ only factoring in the last 4 years)
 - RIBS (BBQ only considering the previous years success)


## Getting Started
